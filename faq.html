                                                <br />
<p>There are certain unavoidable issues involved with  the way healthcare is administered in hospitals in today&rsquo;s world. Let&rsquo;s discuss  some hypothetical examples and highlight potential problems that a consumer may  face in hospitals:</p>
                                                <ol>
                                                  <li>Medicine  has become so super-specialized that sometimes it is difficult even for your doctor  to decide which of his colleagues would best treat a particular ailment. A hospital&rsquo;s  panel of consultants (the board listing all doctors at the hospital, right at  the entrance of the hospital) typically has thirty or more specialties. In such  a scenario, it becomes difficult to zero-in on the right specialist. &nbsp;For instance, a common headache may be caused  by diverse factors like high blood pressure, eye disorders, sinusitis or &nbsp;colds. It will save you tremendous time and  resources if you knew which amongst the many specialists listed would treat  your headache the best.</li>
                                                  <li>&nbsp;Also, in a hospital/ clinic, it may be  difficult to verify the antecedents and training of the specialist whom you  have visited or have been referred to. Due to tremendous overlap between  specialties as well as between different systems of medicines such as  Ayurveda/homeopathy, it is recommended that you know your doctor fully before  you visit him/her. For instance, if your doctor diagnoses sinusitis and recommends  sinus surgery as a treatment for your headache, would you be convinced enough  to go for the surgery or would you rather take a second opinion? Wouldn&rsquo;t you  want to gather enough facts and information before you make such an important  decision? Sometimes the communication may not be satisfactory and other options  may not have been explained adequately. Before proceeding with any surgery or  therapy, it may be wise to explore newer therapies and techniques by consulting  a renowned specialist. </li>
                                                </ol>
                                                <p>Medicare  attempts to solve some of these issues by:</p>
                                                <ol>
                                                  <li>Providing  you a panel of doctors chosen carefully from amongst the best world over.</li>
                                                  <li>Providing  information that allows you to choose the appropriate specialist for YOUR  problem. The information displayed about all doctors on Medicare  is verified and presented in a standard format reducing unnecessary clutter and  confusion.</li>
                                                  <li>Providing  physician support to assist you in making a crucial decision if you are still  in doubt. Even after making a choice, there will be checks in place to help you  make corrections in case you have made an error in choosing the specialist or specialty.</li>
                                                  <li>Teaching  you how to decipher whether your doctor is equipped to deal with YOUR particular  ailment and helping you make a well-informed and appropriate decision. </li>
                                                  <li>Staying  away from the &lsquo;conflict of interest&rsquo; angle providing you with honest, objective  and unbiased opinions.</li>
                                                </ol>

                                                <p><strong>Credible Care</strong><br />
                                                  Medicare gives you access to  the best care-givers for your specific ailment. The unique and user-friendly &nbsp;system allows you to quickly sift through the  panel and find the most specialized and experienced doctor for your health  problems.<br />
  <strong>Affordable</strong><br />
                                                  A typical Medicare query can cost as little as USD $10. &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Ethical</strong><br />
                                                  Your Medicare physicians will not  be driven by monetary interests when they advise you for or against surgery as  they will not be performing your surgery themselves. They are also carefully  chosen to ensure that they do not have any personal affiliations with pharmaceutical  and medical device companies.<br />
  <strong>Evidence-based Care</strong><br />
                                                  Your Medicare physician will  provide you care based on the current strength of peer-reviewed evidence in  medical literature.<br />
  <strong>Convenient</strong> <br />
                                                  You can seek an opinion from the best doctors globally, from the comfort of  your home, at a click. <br />
  <strong>Confidential</strong><br />
                                                  We follow all SSL / encryption protocols for data privacy on the net  through Verisign and eTrust as well as all HIPAA &nbsp;guidelines for patient data protection and  privacy.We will only share your  information with healthcare professionals selected and authorized by you.  The website is securely encrypted and modules regulate who can access your data.  We would like to add that Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (P.L.104-191)  enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996&nbsp; is one of the toughest acts to satisfy world  over for a business of this kind<br />
  <strong>Efficient</strong><br />
                                                  Now, you do not have to travel long miles, struggle for an appointment or wait  for hours at the doctor&rsquo;s office.<br />
  <strong>Safe</strong><br />
                                                  Our medical specialists are credentialed, individually trained and personally  interviewed by our Director, Medical Operations and routinely monitored to  evaluate the quality of their care. Medicare has a Quality  Assurance &amp; Ethics Maintenance Committee consisting of a neutral panel of  seven highly-placed individuals, from different walks of life and &nbsp;different nationalities. This Committee is led  by one of the top-most physicians of the world, who is not a part of the Physician  Panel, to ensure neutrality. This Committee audits a set number of consults  every month to ensure that you get the best possible care.<br />
  <strong>Secure</strong><br />
                                                  Our site, communications, and our patients data are all safely secured, 128 SSL  encrypted and backed up in compliance with international laws and regulations.<br />
                                                  So, even if you could have written to the same physician via email or  through a query on his website, it is just NOT the same as interacting via Medicare in terms of &nbsp;getting a  personalized medical opinion, signed out officially by your specialist after  consultation at the Global eHospital. Many physicians actually find it easier  to communicate systematically via Medicare instead of answering  queries in a haphazard manner from their own website. For this reason, many  have chosen to place a Medicare logo on their website that  directs traffic to their Medicare profile page.</p>

                                                eQuery  is a service that allows you to put up a health-related question to your chosen  specialty in less than 60 words. NO documents can be uploaded through this  facility. Medicares recommends that you use this facility only  to ask basic medical queries and to get a generic idea about your condition or  treatment options. eQuery cannot be used to seek complete treatment as  specialists would be unable to suggest any without looking at investigations  and detailed reports. To upload these, you will need to use &nbsp;the eConsult facility.
